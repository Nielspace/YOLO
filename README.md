# YOLO

You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It was part of darknet open source framework. 

To know more vist the website at <a href='https://pjreddie.com/darknet/'> www.pjreddie.com/darknet/ </a>. 

-----------------------------------

In this project I have not used darknet frame work instead I used opencv-python framework. 

The website provides you with <b>weights</b> and remaining info can be fetched from the github repo of the same. Darknet provides various config files for different models prominently Imagenet, VGG16 and so forth. They also provide you with weights required for a particular model. 

## Why use YOLO?

Beacause, the model has already been trained on various dataset like <b>coco</b> dataset. We just need to impliment it. Also the CNN architecture that have been used to create an algorithms such as this is pretty data heavy and also time consuming. 
So, it is better to use pretrained models if you are learning or even if you are a beginner. You always reverse engineer the whole algorithm to get more insights.

## More Info

Watch this <a href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgxsv1riJhI'>TED</a> talk in youtube given by Joseph Redmon to get a more clear understanding of the project. Learn how Joseph Redmon works on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) system, an open-source method of object detection that can identify objects in images and video -- from zebras to stop signs -- with lightning-quick speed. In a remarkable live demo, Redmon shows off this important step forward for applications like self-driving cars, robotics and even cancer detection.

--------------------------------
## ToDo
- deploy the model in real time
- to replicate the same using pytorch and also keras
